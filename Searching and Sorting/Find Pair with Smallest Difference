// Problem statement
// Given two unsorted arrays of non-negative integers, 'arr1' and 'arr2' of size 'N' and 'M', respectively. Your task is to find the pair of elements (one from each array), such that their absolute (non-negative) difference is the smallest, and return the min difference.
public class Solution {
    public static int smallestDifferencePair(int []arr1, int n, int []arr2, int m) {
        // Write your code here.
        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
                int temp;
                if(arr1[i] > arr2[j]){
                    temp = arr1[i] - arr2[j];
                }else{
                    temp = arr2[j] - arr1[i];
                }
                if(temp < diff){
                    diff = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        return diff;
